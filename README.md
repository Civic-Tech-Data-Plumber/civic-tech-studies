# civiltech-studies

A learning journal documenting my path toward data engineering in civil technology, with a focus on transparency, ethics, and justice-oriented data systems.

## About This Project

This repository serves as a public learning log as I study SQL, data engineering concepts, and data practices relevant to civil technology. The long-term aim is to build high-fidelity data dashboards that allow users to explore aggregated data from U.S. court proceedings.

In a system where fairness and justice are often questioned, I believe responsible data work can help clarify where trust is warranted—and where it is not.

## Goals

- Learn and document SQL and data engineering fundamentals
- Explore ethical data aggregation in the context of public legal data
- Experiment (carefully) with LLM-assisted workflows for summarization and analysis, while preserving factual accuracy and data integrity

## Current Status

This is an early-stage project. Most content currently consists of:
- Markdown notes and blog-style entries
- SQL learning exercises
- Exploratory research and design thinking

Expect rough edges and frequent iteration.

## Values and Constraints

- Data should remain factual and unaltered
- Sources should be attributable and auditable
- Automation should support understanding, not obscure truth

## Feedback and Contributions

This project is primarily for learning, but thoughtful feedback, corrections, and guidance are welcome.
