# civiltech-studies
Brief Description: A blog showcasing my studies to become a data engineer in civil tech.
Full Description: This blog is designed to showcase what I am learning to become a responsible civil tech. 
My goal is to create high fidelity data dashboards to allow users to quickly view aggregated data of USA's court proceedings.
In a world where law and justice needs to be fair, many feel as though it isn't. I'm hoping that the data I produce can help alleviate those fears or justify them. 
Utilizing LLMs (AI) to help aggregate data, I aim to ensure all data is factual, unaltered, and of the highest quality.

This is a new project, and I am a noob. I accept any help offered. My email is 1kc.finex@gmail.com
